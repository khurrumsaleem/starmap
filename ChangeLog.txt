StaRMAP ChangeLog
=================================================================

=================================================================
Version 1.9 --> Version 2.0  (06/28/2022)
=================================================================
** Fundamental Changes **
- The starmap_solver.m file now solves 3D problems.
- The file starmap_init.m was added to the pipeline. The moment
  matrices are new created in it. Moreover, user-specified 1D and
  2D problems are converted into 3D data structures, so that the
  starmap_solver.m file can solve them (by prescribing the other
  dimensions to have 1 grid point).
- PN and SPN moment matrices for 1D, 2D, and 3D are now available
  in starmap_closure_pn.m and starmap_closure_spn.m.
- Removed diffusion correction closure from starmap_solver.m.

** Examples Files **
- Changed naming convention to include dimension in file name.
- Example files now call starmap_init.m to set up variables for
  running starmap_solver.m.
- User-defined problem structures renamed to prob.
- Removed diffusion correction closure tests from
  starmap_2d_ex_homogeneous.m.
- Added starmap_1d_ex_gauss.m
- Added starmap_1d_ex_planesource.m
- Added starmap_2d_ex_asymptotic_preserving.m
- Added starmap_3d_ex_lattice.m
- Added starmap_3d_ex_pointsource.m

** Other Changes **
- The software is now hosted on GitHub.
- Links adapted in all files.

=================================================================
Version 1.5 --> Version 1.9  (03/13/2015)
=================================================================
- all example files: Changed naming convention of par.closure.

- starmap_ex_homogeneous.m: This test case was added.

- starmap_ex_lattice_diffusion.m: This test case was added.

- starmap_solver.m: Added parabolic time step (determined
  automatically) and diffusion correction closure.

=================================================================
Version 1.1 --> Version 1.5  (10/10/2014)
=================================================================
- starmap_create_hemisphere_filter_convergence.m: This test case
  was added.

- starmap_ex_checkerboard.m: This file was renamed to
  starmap_ex_lattice.m.

- starmap_ex_gauss_filter_convergence.m: This test case was
  added.

- starmap_ex_lattice.m: This file is what was previously the file
  starmap_ex_checkerboard.m.

- starmap_ex_lattice_filter.m: This test case was added.

- starmap_ex_lattice_filter_convergence: This test case was
  added.

- starmap_ex_linesource_filter.m: This test case was added.

- starpmap_ex_linesource_filter_reconstruction.m: This test case
  was added.

- starmap_solver.m: Added filtering steps and functions.

=================================================================
Version 1.0 --> Version 1.1  (07/14/2013)
=================================================================
- starmap_create_beam.m: Added a comment that due to the void in
  the domain, the moment approximation cannot be used to solve
  for a steady state solution.

- starmap_create_mms.m: Added a comment regarding the need of
  the Symbolic Toolbox.
- starmap_create_mms.m: Now the errors for all moments are
  computed and plotted in sub-figures. Different components of
  the same moment order are combined into a single error value.

- starmap_ex_boxes.m: Adapted to account for new output argument
  structure of starmap_solver.m.

- starmap_ex_checkerboard.m: Added a cross section plot,
  evaluated along the line x=3.5.
- starmap_ex_checkerboard.m: Modified plotting color scale.
  Negative radiative intensities are now depicted in gray.

- starmap_ex_l2norm.m: This test case was added.

- starmap_ex_linesource.m: Added two remarks; one regarding the
  width of the initial Gaussian, and another regarding the use
  of the SPN approximation.
- starmap_ex_linesource.m: Addressed an error that occurred when
  providing a zero initial radiative intensity.

- starmap_solver.m: Added text output of test case information
  and number of moments, grid cells, and time steps.
- starmap_solver.m: Output arguments are now all grids and all
  solution components.
